    <h1>Editorial Standards &amp; AI Policy – The Bias</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> [DATE]<br>
       <strong>Last updated:</strong> [DATE]</p>

    <p>This policy explains how The Bias creates articles, our commitment to neutrality, how we use AI, the limitations of AI-generated content, and the safeguards we use to reduce bias and misinformation.</p>

    <h2>1) Our mission: neutral, unbiased reporting</h2>

    <p>The Bias exists to produce news articles that are as neutral and unbiased as possible.</p>

    <p>Our goal is that every article:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>presents information without taking sides</li>
      <li>avoids opinion, persuasion, or emotionally loaded framing</li>
      <li>distinguishes between established facts and uncertainty</li>
      <li>fairly reflects what credible sources report, including where reputable sources disagree</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We aim to provide a clear, balanced view that cannot be obtained from a single source article alone.</p>

    <h2>2) How The Bias creates original articles using AI</h2>

    <p>The Bias produces original reports that are founded on the analysis of multiple existing source articles.</p>

    <p>In general, our workflow is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Source selection:</strong> our systems gather multiple relevant source articles for a topic.</li>
      <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> our AI models analyse the source articles to identify key claims, facts, and points of disagreement.</li>
      <li><strong>Synthesis:</strong> our AI models produce a new article in our own words, designed to present a neutral, unbiased perspective based on the combined sources.</li>
      <li><strong>Attribution:</strong> we maintain traceability between claims and the sources that support them (see Section 4).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We avoid human editorial input because humans can unintentionally introduce personal judgement and bias. Our approach is fully automated and designed to reduce bias as much as possible through consistent processes and safeguards.</p>

    <h2>3) AI limitations and important disclaimers</h2>

    <p>AI systems can make mistakes. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>hallucinations (stating something as fact that is not supported by sources)</li>
      <li>misinterpretation of a source</li>
      <li>missing context or nuance</li>
      <li>unintentional bias introduced through wording, emphasis, or omission</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Because of these limitations, content in The Bias should be treated as informational and not definitive.</p>

    <h3>Not professional advice; decisions are your responsibility</h3>

    <p>The Bias does not provide financial advice, legal advice, medical advice, or any other professional advice. You should not rely on content in The Bias to make financial, legal, medical, or other high-stakes decisions. If you need advice, consult a qualified professional and/or primary sources.</p>

    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, The Bias is not responsible for losses, damages, or decisions made based on information in the Service.</p>

    <h2>4) Transparency: how sources and claim support work</h2>

    <p>We are committed to transparency about where information comes from.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sources list:</strong> for every article, the source articles used are listed at the bottom of the article page.</li>
      <li><strong>Per-claim citations (Premium):</strong> Premium members can access Claim Mode (the magnifying glass at the top left of the toolbar). Claim Mode shows each claim and the source article that supports it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This design supports accountability and enables users to verify important claims directly.</p>

    <h2>5) Safeguards to prevent and detect misinformation and bias</h2>

    <p>We continuously develop our systems and processes to prevent and detect misinformation and bias. Safeguards currently in place include:</p>

    <h3>A) Fact-checking through source traceability</h3>
    <p>Every claim we make is referenced back to a source article where that piece of information was obtained.</p>
    <p>Where a claim cannot be supported by a source, it should not be presented as a factual statement.</p>

    <h3>B) Mechanical checks against the source</h3>
    <p>We run mechanical checks back to the source to help ensure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the claim accurately represents what the source said</li>
      <li>key qualifiers are not removed (for example, “may”, “reportedly”, “according to”)</li>
      <li>the claim is not overstated beyond the source</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C) Spot checks (periodic inspection)</h3>
    <p>Random articles are periodically selected and inspected against their sources to ensure they:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>present a true and fair view of the sources</li>
      <li>do not contain biased framing or misleading emphasis</li>
      <li>do not contain misinformation or unsupported claims</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Corrections and reporting issues</h2>

    <p>If you believe an article is inaccurate, misleading, biased, or improperly sourced, you can report it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In-app:</strong> select “Report an issue” at the bottom of any article page</li>
      <li><strong>Email:</strong> corrections@thebias.co.uk</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We review reports and investigate thoroughly. Where we identify a material issue, we aim to correct or update the article and improve our safeguards to reduce the chance of similar issues recurring.</p>

    <h2>7) Ongoing improvement</h2>

    <p>We view this as an evolving system. We are committed to continuing development of safeguards and quality controls, including improvements that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>strengthen detection of unsupported claims and hallucinations</li>
      <li>improve handling of uncertainty and breaking news</li>
      <li>reduce biased framing and loaded language</li>
      <li>improve traceability and user transparency features</li>
      <li>incorporate learnings from spot checks and user reports into future system improvements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Updates to this policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this policy as The Bias evolves. The “Last updated” date reflects the latest revision.</p>
