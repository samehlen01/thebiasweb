    <h1>About The Bias</h1>

    <p>We’re two brothers who read the news daily. Over time, we found ourselves feeling like we were constantly being shown one side of the story, not just the facts, but a narrative. The more we read, the more we noticed how often the same event could be framed in completely different ways depending on where you looked.</p>

    <p>So we went searching for something we thought should already exist: a truly neutral source of news.</p>

    <p>Plenty of outlets claim to be unbiased. But we couldn’t find any that could truly substantiate that claim, not in a way that we could genuinely trust. That’s why we chose automation: to build a consistent, repeatable process that aims to minimise bias and provides transparency, so neutrality isn’t just promised, it’s evidenced.</p>

    <p>That’s when we decided: if we can’t find it, we’ll build it. The Bias was born.</p>

    <h2>From idea to reality</h2>

    <p>The original idea came in September 2025. Since then, the product has evolved far beyond what we first imagined. Our process is now much more sophisticated than the original service we dreamed up. We have developed algorithms we could never have imagined when we set out, and learnt so much along the way.</p>

    <p>We’ve also added features we believe make reading the news feel better than what you get from standard mainstream outlets — not just more informative, but more transparent and more accountable. The Bias doesn’t only restore trust in the news we read but makes it enjoyable again.</p>

    <p>And we’re only getting started. We have an infinite list of ideas and improvements we want to bring to life.</p>

    <h2>What we stand for</h2>

    <p>We’re committed to building The Bias into the highest-quality neutral news experience we can make. We prioritise:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>neutrality and fairness</li>
      <li>transparency and source traceability</li>
      <li>a reading experience that respects your time and intelligence</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our goal is simple: help bring trust back to the media by letting people see a clearer picture of what’s happening, without being pushed toward a side. For us success would look like empowering people to make up their own minds, and to restore the constructive dialogue that our modern polarised media has killed.</p>

    <h2>The media revolution is here</h2>

    <p>We believe the future of news is transparent, balanced, and system-driven.</p>

    <p>The media revolution is here.<br>Welcome to The Bias.</p>
