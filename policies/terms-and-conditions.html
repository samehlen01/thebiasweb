    <ul>
      <li>protect the security or integrity of the Service</li>
      <li>prevent misuse, fraud, or unlawful activity</li>
      <li>enforce these Terms</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) The Service</h2>

    <p>The Service provides access to news content and related features.</p>
    <p>Content is provided for general information purposes. While we aim for accuracy, we do not guarantee that content will always be complete, current, or error-free.</p>

    <h2>5) Subscriptions (Apple billing only)</h2>

    <p>Some features are available only with a paid subscription (“Subscription”). Subscriptions are purchased only via Apple’s in-app purchase system.</p>

    <h3>5.1 Plans and pricing</h3>

    <p>We currently offer these auto-renewing subscriptions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Premium Monthly — £7.99 per month</li>
      <li>Premium Yearly — £89.99 per year</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pricing may change in the future. Any changes for Apple-billed subscriptions are handled under Apple’s processes.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Auto-renewal</h3>

    <p>Unless you cancel, your Subscription automatically renews at the end of each billing period. Apple will charge the payment method associated with your Apple ID.</p>

    <h3>5.3 Free trial</h3>

    <p>We offer a 7-day free trial (where available). Unless you cancel before the trial ends, your Subscription will convert to a paid subscription and you will be charged via Apple.</p>

    <h3>5.4 Managing and cancelling</h3>

    <p>You can manage or cancel your Subscription through your Apple ID subscription settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period (or trial), and you will retain access until then.</p>

    <h3>5.5 Refunds</h3>

    <p>Purchases are processed by Apple. We do not offer refunds directly. If you believe a refund is appropriate, you must request it through Apple under Apple’s policies and processes.</p>

    <h2>6) Acceptable use</h2>

    <p>You must not:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>7) AI-assisted features</h2>

    <p>The Service may include AI-assisted features (for example, summarisation of article text). AI outputs may be incorrect or incomplete. Do not rely on AI outputs as professional advice (including legal, medical, or financial advice).</p>

    <h2>8) Intellectual property</h2>

    <p>The App, branding, and associated intellectual property rights are owned by or licensed to us. We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>9) Changes to the Service and Terms</h2>

    <p>We may update the Service or these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in-app.</p>
    <p>If you do not agree to changes, you should stop using the Service and (if you have a Subscription) cancel it through Apple.</p>

    <h2>10) Liability</h2>

    <p>Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes liability where it would be unlawful to do so (including liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or fraud).</p>
    <p>Subject to that, we are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us. We are not responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>losses not caused by our breach or negligence</li>
      <li>business losses (the Service is for personal/consumer use)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights as a consumer.</p>

    <h2>11) Privacy</h2>

    <p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we handle personal data and forms part of your agreement with us. It is available within the App and/or where we otherwise make it available to you.</p>

    <h2>12) Termination and account deletion</h2>

    <p>You may stop using the Service at any time.</p>

    <p>You can delete your account in the App:</p>
    <p><strong>Profile icon (top right) → Delete account</strong></p>

    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access as described in these Terms. If your account is terminated, access to subscription features may end, subject to Apple’s processes.</p>
